# Auction Company Program

## Purpose of Program

This program is meant to work as a
reporting system for an auction company
which specialises in antique furniture,
paintings and sculptures. The program
is responsible for storing details 
regarding the items sold by each 
auction house, and for tracking
the performances of the houses.

### How to Run 
Due to the lack of the class 
ReportingIO, which is supposed
to include the main method,
the program does not
really do anything.
